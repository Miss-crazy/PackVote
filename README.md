# PackVote

PackVote is an AI-powered group travel planning system that generates personalized trip recommendations by aggregating user preferences and integrating data from APIs like Google Places, Amadeus, and OpenAI. For cost-efficiency and ease of development, this project currently uses **mock APIs** that simulate real API responses, enabling local testing without requiring API keys or incurring charges.

---

## Features

- Modular architecture separating services, data pipelines, CLI, and configuration  
- Mock API implementations for Google Places, Amadeus, and OpenAI for offline usage  
- Aggregates individual group member preferences to generate group-wide travel recommendations  
- Stores persistent data in an SQLite database to manage groups, members, places, and recommendations  
- Provides top 5 most relevant recommendations tailored to group preferences  
- Environment variable toggle to switch easily between mock and real APIs

## Setup Instructions

### Environment Setup using Conda

conda create -n packvote_env python=3.10 pip -y <br>
conda activate packvote_env<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt<br>

### Running the Project with Mock APIs

- On PowerShell (Windows):

$env:USE_MOCK_APIS = "true"<br>
python -m PackVote.cli.generate_recs 1<br>

- On Linux/macOS Terminal:

export USE_MOCK_APIS=true<br>
python -m PackVote.cli.generate_recs 1<br>

## Project Architecture

- `PackVote/cli/`: Command-line scripts to run recommendation generation.  
- `PackVote/pipelines/`: Orchestrates fetching facts, generating recommendations, and persisting results.  
- `PackVote/services/`: Contains API service modules, real and mock implementations, and business logic for recommendation generation and data fetching.  
- `PackVote/sql/`: Database setup and query modules for persisting groups, members, places, and recommendations.  
- `config.py`: Configuration for environment variables, database paths, and API keys.

## Data Storage and Group Model

PackVote uses a lightweight SQLite database (`packvote.sqlite`) to store:

- **Group ID:** Unique identifier for a group of travelers planning together.  
- **Member ID:** Unique identifiers for individual group members, tracking their availability, preferences, visited places, trip length, and budgets.  
- **Places & Recommendations:** Details about recommended places and the AI-generated summaries tailored for the group.  
- **Historical Data:** Records past recommendations and visits for iterative enhancement.

The system aggregates individual preferences to generate **top 5 most relevant, personalized recommendations** for the entire group.

## Why Mock APIs?

- To minimize development costs and avoid API usage charges.  
- To enable stable, repeatable local testing without needing live API keys.  
- Facilitates modular code design whereby switching to live APIs requires minimal changes.

---

## Future Directions

- Integrate real API keys to fetch live data for production use.  
- Build user-facing web or mobile frontends.  
- Expand AI personalization, multi-user collaboration, and scheduling optimizations.

---

## What is `recs`?

`recs` refers to the **recommendations**—a list of suggested places and activities generated by AI summarizing facts aggregated from API queries and user inputs.

---

## Database Updates and Real API Impact

- Each run using `generate_recs` inserts or updates recommendations and related data in the SQLite database to maintain state.  
- Using real APIs with valid keys will update the database with live, accurate place data and AI-generated recommendations.  
- The design abstracts the source—mock or real—ensuring persistent storage reflects the true data source seamlessly.
